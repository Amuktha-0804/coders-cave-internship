Online Code Editor:
This is the project of a code editor where i have incorporated the running of 5 differenty languages.

Important points:
1----First to run the project you have to run server.py in your local system.
2----The place from where you are running the server should contain all the dependencies needed for running
     otherwise it will show an error of undefined reference
3----If you want to run the java code the main public class must be named as user_code as the server takes the code
     and creates a temporary file it doesnt know what class was present in the code to create the file.Hence the code
     must be written in user_code public class.
